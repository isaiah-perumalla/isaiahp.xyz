      <description>TL;DR  Logging is a feature of a system Primary consumer of logs are machines Use events in logs to verify a running system There are benefits to using Binary encoding  Logging can be an effective way of gathering data from a system and observing its runtime behaviour. In my experience most of application logging is ad-hoc text, which greatly diminishes the potential value of logging. Most systems tend to start off with very little logging or no logging, as the system grows and problems arise developers add additional logging, which leads to megabytes/gigabytes of similar looking text, what make things worse it often not clear what information should be logged, developers often log debug/trace level diagnostic information in development but turned off in production, which makes it very difficult to extract meaningful information to troubleshoot a problem in production, as it may be missing crucial information.</description>
