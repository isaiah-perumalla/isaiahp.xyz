This is a very simplified introduction to understanding what bitcoin is, bitcoin itself is not one thing, it can be divided into 3 parts

1. Bitcoin as currency
2. payment network system
3. blockchain underlying technology

# Bitcoin as currency

let first look at what money/currency is.
Gold is actually the most successful currency in history and always percieved as store of value because it has the following properties.
1. Gold is scarce, difficult to find
2. There is a finite supply, goverments cannot simply decide to create more gold
3. The supply of gold cannot be controlled by anybody

One of the drawbacks of gold is cumbersome, and in some cases impossible. To buy something you would exchange a precise amount of physical cash for the goods or services required

In general modern currency (*Fiat currency*) is backed by a government and issued by a central bank, while cash is familiar and very flexible it has some 
* transfered electronicall through a central processing system
* annoymity 
### drawbacks.
1. the supply can increased by the goverment
2. completely reliant on the banking system, example if your bank were to collapse a saver is only covered by up to £85,000 per bank, and there’s no guarantee that this or future governments will bail banks out.

this is what makes Bitcoin such an interesting technological and economic experiment
Bitcoin’s  resides in both the future value of online transactions conducted through its networks, but also in a sense of belief that eventually, there will be a need to delegate financial trust and authority.

## Payment network system


- when you pay in cash* a bank does not come in to the picture, in this regard cash offers better anonymity. cash allows payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. for example you can give your friend £20 withouth any central authority or third party getting invloved.

The image above is 20 pound note issued by the bank of england. 
- it has a serial number
- it has additional anti-forgery stuff to esure it not easily replicated.

With online shopping payment system relies exclusively on credit/debit cards where some third party or financial institution is invloved in the payment process. Unlike cash there is no annoyminity in this system the third party can monitor each persons transcations.

"Is it possible to create a digital money that is it own currency, where it is issued and value independently of any other asset or currency ?"

Crypto currencies are an answer to the question above.

## What the big deal
To appreciate why this is big deal , it useful to think about the following 


"if we were to digital cash , how would we do this electronically ?" <cite> </cite>


## Attempt-1
one way could be create a piece of data representing some a unit of virtual cash, with a digital signature.
In physical world once you hand once you spent the cash , it gone you cannot respent, however in the digital world, it very simple to make copies of digital cash and keep spending the same note over and over again.
## Attempt-2 
To avoid the scenario above each time we receive cash from someone we could record it as spend in some database the serial number of spent virtual cash,  This way if we received the same virtual note again we can look up this central database to check if the serial number of virtual cash has been spent already. 
However if we wanted to spend the cash we received we would not be able to sped it as In this system cash can only be spent once. To over come this problem we could take the spent cash to a central authority and get them to issue us new cash with new serial numbers (this is easy to do in the digital).

The above scheme could work but there are two glaring problems.

- A trust central authority and cenral database is required.
- This is no longer the same as physical cash it is not annoymous anymore each time we spent cash this is recorded in a database. Even in the simple case where you hand £20 to a friend in not longer annoymous in this digital system above.

Is this possible to create a digital cash system 
- where there is no need for a central/trusted authority

- digtal cash transactions are annoymous

- have some way to regulate the create creation of new digtial cash without a central trusted authority.

Bitcoin is digtial cash which solves the problems above without requiring a central trusted authority.
