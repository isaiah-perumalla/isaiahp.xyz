This is a very simplified introduction to understanding what bitcoin is, bitcoin itself is not one thing, it can be divided into 3 parts

1. P2P Payment network system 
2. Bitcoin as currency
3. Blockchain underlying technology

# P2P payment system

In the current internet age it very simple for use to send an email or file to another person electronically, however if you wanted to some money to a friend this is not possible electronically without a *trusted* third party, where hand over you personal details get a bank account or sign up to some third party payment system like paypal etc.

Bitcoin is *peer-to-peer* version of a payment system that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another *without* going through a financial institution or worrying about geographical borders.
It is completely decentralised network, so there isnt one single party in control of it, nor do you have to trust any single party.

> An electionic payment system based on *cryptographic* proof instead of trust

Such a payment system opens up many possiblilites, for example most emerging countries have access to internet however have very unstable goverments and financial systems. Bitcoin allows any single computer device on the planet with an internet connection can access information on this *peer to peer* network. 
> Paying in bitcoin is similar to handing someone some cash

> Bitcoin enables us to send funds to people without access to banks or who live in politically unstable countries 

* for example Bitcoin enables us to send money to a farmer or entreprenuer in an emerging country without invovlement of a financial institution or goverment
* transcantional cannot be distorted, deleted, modified or destroyed by any corrupt government 

The payment system is designed to be independent of banks, coorperation or any centralized institution, with bitcoin anyone can create their own "account" be the owner of *digital keys* necessary to spend their funds.
Given that all currencies are controlled by some government, bitcoin and it uses it *own currency* to acheived this. 


# Bitcoin as currency

So acheive a completly decentalized payment system, it uses it own currency system, but why does bitcoin even have any value ?
let first look at what money/currency is.
> Gold is actually the most successful currency in history 
![Gold ](/imgs/gold.jpg)

Gold has always percieved as store of value because it has the following properties.
1. Gold is scarce, difficult to find
2. There is a finite supply, goverments cannot simply decide to create more gold
3. The supply of gold cannot be controlled by anybody

One of the drawbacks of gold is it not portable, you cant simply send a tiny shaving of gold to someone else on the internet to buy some good or services. 

In general modern currency (*Fiat currency*) is backed by a government and issued by a central bank, while cash is familiar and very flexible it has some 
> Cash is completely relian on the banking system and supply can be increase by goverment

> Unlike gold, the supply of money can be increased by the government

### drawbacks.
1. the supply can increased by the goverment
2. completely reliant on the banking system, example if your bank were to collapse a saver is only covered by up to £85,000 per bank, and there’s no guarantee that this or future governments will bail banks out.

> Bitcoin is like digital gold, where you can exchange it over internet
![digital gold](/imgs/bitcoin-3024279_1920.jpg)
Bitcoin has similar properties of gold, but can be transmitted digitally over the internet without any trusted party invloved.
1. Bitcoin supply is finite, it is fixed to 21 million bitcoins
2. Bitcoin is scarce, it take compuational power to create a bitcoin 
3. System based on cryptography cannot be maniputalted or tampered with
3. The supply cannot be manipulated by any single authority or organization

This is what makes Bitcoin so intersting technological and economically. The value of bitcoin come from the belief that eventually, be a need for a system where there is reliance on a single organization of authority.
